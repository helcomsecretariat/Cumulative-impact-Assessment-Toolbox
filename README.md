# Cumulative-impact-Assessment-Toolbox
The Baltic Sea Impact Index (BSII) Cumulative impact Assessment Toolbox includes following tools:

Baltic Sea Impact Index tool (BSII tool) – calculates the Baltic Sea Impact Index. It uses data layers on ecosystem components and pressures (grid layers), as well as a sensitivity scores matrix as input, and creates a BSII grid layer as output. The tool also creates a BSII statistics matrix, which shows how much each ecosystem component and pressure combination contributes to total impact.

Baltic Sea Pressure Index tool (BSPI tool) – calculates the Baltic Sea Pressure Index. It uses data layers on pressures (grid layers), as well as a sensitivity scores matrix as an input, and creates a BSPI grid layer as output.

Ecological Value tool (EV tool) – supports the identification of areas with high ecological value. It uses data layers on ecosystem components (grid layers) and an ecological value matrix as input. The assessment is performed for each selected ecological value criterion and ecosystem component group, as identified by the matrix. The grid layers are further aggregated to create results for: each combination of criterion and group, for all criteria within each group, and as a total ecological value grid layer.

Ecosystem Service tool (ES tool) – supports the identification of areas with high potential provision of ecosystem services. It uses data layers on ecosystem components (grid layers) and an ecosystem services matrix as input. The assessment is performed for each selected ecosystem service and ecosystem component sub-group, as identified by the matrix. Output grid layers are created for: each combination of ecosystem service and ecosystem component sub-group, as an aggregated result for each ecosystem component sub-group, and as a total ecosystem service grid layer.

Baltic Sea Impact Index Batch tool for Ecological Values or Ecosystem Services (BSII Batch tool) –calculates the Baltic Sea Impact Index with respect to areas identified as important for ecological value or for the provision of ecosystem services. Upon selection, it addresses either each combination of ecological value criteria and ecosystem component group, or each combination of ecosystem service and ecosystem component sub-group, following the same structure as in the EV and ES tools, respectively. As input, the tool uses data layers on ecosystem components and pressures (grid layers), as well as specific sensitivity scores matrices (See below). It creates BSII grid layers for each matrix as output. Optionally, the tool also creates BSII statistics matrices. The sensitivity scores matrices needed for input to this tool can be created with the Sensitivity score matrices for BSII Batch Tool.

Sensitivity score matrices for BSII Batch Tool – creates new sensitivity score matrices by combination of existing matrices. Using the BSII sensitivity scores matrix and either the ecological value or ecosystem services coefficients matrices as input, the tool creates one specific sensitivity score matrix for each combination of ecological value criteria and ecosystem component group, or for each combination of ecosystem service and ecosystem component sub-group.
